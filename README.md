Shooting Barn

This is the game I made as part of a group project for CS 347 (Game Design and Development) at UAH in the Spring of 2021.  I have extracted the scene that was my own work from the original game into this repository. The full game can be found at https://github.com/tgoodwyn/CS-347-Project-2.
For this scene, I designed and laid out the level using free assets from the Unity Asset Store.  I also created the character controller, as well as  a level generation system using Scriptable Objects for rapid prototyping.
